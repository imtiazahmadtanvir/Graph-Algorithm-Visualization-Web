## 🧩 Algorithms Included

### 🔍 **Pathfinding**
- **A\*** – Best-first search using cost + heuristic.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** – Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.

### 🔄 **Traversal**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Explores layer by layer.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores depth before breadth.

### 🌲 **Spanning Tree**
- **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** – Connects all nodes with the minimal total edge weight.

### 🎨 **Coloring**
- **Graph Coloring** – Assigns colors to nodes such that no adjacent nodes share the same color.
